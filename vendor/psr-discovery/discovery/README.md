**Lightweight library that discovers available PSR implementations by searching for a list of well-known classes that implement the relevant interfaces, and returning an instance of the first one that is found.**

The library currently supports [PSR-18 HTTP Clients](https://github.com/psr-discovery/http-client-implementations), [PSR-17 HTTP Factories](https://github.com/psr-discovery/http-factory-implementations), [PSR-14 Event Dispatchers](https://github.com/psr-discovery/event-dispatcher-implementations), [PSR-11 Containers](https://github.com/psr-discovery/container-implementations), [PSR-6 Caches](https://github.com/psr-discovery/cache-implementations) and [PSR-3 Logs](https://github.com/psr-discovery/log-implementations).

This is largely intended for inclusion in libraries like SDKs that wish to support PSR interfaces without requiring hard dependencies on specific implementations or demanding extra configuration by users.

## Requirements

-   PHP 8.0+
-   Composer 2.0+

The discovery of a particular interface requires the presence of a compatible implementation in the host application. This library does not install any implementations for you.

## Installation

You should install the appropriate dependencies from the list below for the PSRs you wish to have discovery support for.

### Meta-Packages

The [psr-discovery/all](https://github.com/psr-discovery/all) meta-package includes all of the discovery suite packages. If you're looking for an all-in-one solution, this is the one you want.

Installation:

```bash
composer require psr-discovery/all
```

See the following sections for more information on the individual usage of each package.

### PSR-18 HTTP Clients

Installation:

```bash
composer require psr-discovery/http-client-implementations
```

Usage:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;

$httpClient = Discover::httpClient();
```

Please see the [psr-discovery/http-client-implementations](https://github.com/psr-discovery/http-client-implementations) repository for a list of the supported implementations. If a particular implementation is missing you'd like to see, please open a pull request adding support.

### PSR-17 HTTP Factories

Installation:

```bash
composer require psr-discovery/http-factory-implementations
```

Usage:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;

// Returns a PSR-17 RequestFactoryInterface instance
$requestFactory = Discover::httpRequestFactory();

// Returns a PSR-17 ResponseFactoryInterface instance
$responseFactory = Discover::httpResponseFactory();

// Returns a PSR-17 StreamFactoryInterface instance
$streamFactory = Discover::httpStreamFactory();

// Returns a PSR-7 RequestInterface instance
$request = $requestFactory->createRequest('GET', 'https://example.com');
```

Please see the [psr-discovery/http-factory-implementations](https://github.com/psr-discovery/http-factory-implementations) repository for a list of the supported implementations. If a particular implementation is missing you'd like to see, please open a pull request adding support.

### PSR-14 Event Dispatchers

Installation:

```bash
composer require psr-discovery/event-dispatcher-implementations
```

Usage:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;

$eventDispatcher = Discover::eventDispatcher();
```

Please see the [psr-discovery/event-dispatcher-implementations](https://github.com/psr-discovery/event-dispatcher-implementations) repository for a list of the supported implementations. If a particular implementation is missing you'd like to see, please open a pull request adding support.

### PSR-11 Containers

Installation:

```bash
composer require psr-discovery/container-implementations
```

Usage:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;

$container = Discover::container();
```

Please see the [psr-discovery/container-implementations](https://github.com/psr-discovery/container-implementations) repository for a list of the supported implementations. If a particular implementation is missing you'd like to see, please open a pull request adding support.

### PSR-6 Caches

Installation:

```bash
composer require psr-discovery/cache-implementations
```

Usage:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;

$cache = Discover::cache();
```

Please see the [psr-discovery/cache-implementations](https://github.com/psr-discovery/cache-implementations) repository for a list of the supported implementations. If a particular implementation is missing you'd like to see, please open a pull request adding support.

### PSR-3 Logs

Installation:

```bash
composer require psr-discovery/log-implementations
```

Usage:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;

$log = Discover::log();
```

Please see the [psr-discovery/log-implementations](https://github.com/psr-discovery/log-implementations) repository for a list of the supported implementations. If a particular implementation is missing you'd like to see, please open a pull request adding support.

## Handling Failures

If the library is unable to discover a suitable implementation, the relevant discovery method will simply return `null`. This allows you to handle the failure gracefully, for example by falling back to a default implementation.

Example:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;

$httpClient = Discover::httpClient();

if ($httpClient === null) {
    // No suitable HTTP Client implementation was discovered.
    // Fall back to a default implementation.
    $httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();
}
```

## Exceptions

The library will expose a `PsrDiscovery\Exceptions\SupportPackageNotFoundException` when a discovery method is called, but the required support package is not installed.

## Singletons

By default, the discovery methods will always return a new instance of the discovered implementation. If you wish to use a singleton instance instead, simply pass `true` to the `$singleton` parameter of the discovery method.

Example:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;

// $httpClient1 !== $httpClient2 (default)
$httpClient1 = Discover::httpClient();
$httpClient2 = Discover::httpClient();

// $httpClient1 === $httpClient2
$httpClient1 = Discover::httpClient(singleton: true);
$httpClient2 = Discover::httpClient(singleton: true);
```

## Mocking Priority

This library will give priority to searching for an available PSR mocking library, like `psr-mock/http-client-implementation` or `php-http/mock-client`.

The expectation is that these mocking libraries will always be installed as development dependencies, and therefore if they are available, they are intended to be used.

## Preferring an Implementation

If you wish to prefer a specific implementation over others, you can use the `prefer()` on any installed discovery support libraries.

Example using `psr-discovery/http-factories-implementations`:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;
use PsrDiscovery\Implementations\Psr17\RequestFactories;

// Prefer the a specific implementation of PSR-17 over others.
RequestFactories::prefer('nyholm/psr7');

// Return an instance of Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory,
// or the next available from the list of candidates,
// Returns null if none are discovered.
$factory = Discover::httpRequestFactory();
```

This will cause the discovery method to return the preferred implementation if it is available, otherwise, it will fall back to the default behavior.

Note that assigning a preferred implementation will give it priority over the default preference of mocking libraries.

## Using a Specific Implementation

If you wish to force a specific implementation and ignore the rest of the discovery candidates, you can use the `use()` on any installed discovery support libraries.

Example using `psr-discovery/http-factories-implementations`:

```php
use PsrDiscovery\Discover;
use PsrDiscovery\Implementations\Psr17\RequestFactories;

// Only discover a specific implementation of PSR-17.
RequestFactories::use('nyholm/psr7');

// Return an instance of Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory,
// or null if it is not available.
$factory = Discover::httpRequestFactory();
```

This will cause the discovery method to return the preferred implementation if it is available, otherwise, it will return `null`.
